# IMSCC_scripts

Extract all regular files from Learning Management Platform Common Cartridge files (IMSCC).  This can help you locate individual files that are contained within an IMSCC archive downloaded from platforms such as Canvas, Brightspace, Moodle or PowerSchool Learning.

## Usage

The scripts are packaged as a Platapus executable that can be run on any modern Mac OS device. Drag and drop the IMSCC file into the application window. These scripts will extract all of the regular files from an IMSCC archive and place them in a folder in `~/Desktop`.
